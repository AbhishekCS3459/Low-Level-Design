# Low Level Design (LLD)

A hands-on repository focused on **Low Level Design concepts in Java**, containing clean, practical implementations of commonly used **design patterns**.

This repository is designed to grow over time and serve as a **reference + practice hub** for mastering object-oriented design and writing maintainable, scalable code.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo aims to:

* Strengthen **Low Level Design (LLD)** fundamentals
* Practice **design patterns with real-world context**
* Write clean, extensible, and testable Java code
* Prepare for **backend and system design interviews**
* Build a reusable personal reference for design patterns

---

## 📌 Design Patterns Covered

Each design pattern is implemented in its **own module/folder**, following clear structure and best practices.

Examples (growing list):

* Strategy Pattern
* Factory Pattern
* Observer Pattern
* Builder Pattern
* Decorator Pattern
* Adapter Pattern

> New patterns will be added incrementally.

##  How to Navigate

* Each pattern lives in an **isolated folder/module**
* Every module may include:

  * Source code (`src/`)
  * Pattern-specific README
  * Examples and use cases
* Patterns focus on **clarity over over-engineering**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java
* **Build Tool:** Maven
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)
* **Java Version:** Java 8+

---

##  Running Any Pattern Module

```bash
cd <pattern-folder>
mvn clean install
```

(or run directly from your IDE)

---

## 📖 Design Principles Emphasized

* SOLID principles
* Programming to interfaces
* Composition over inheritance
* Separation of concerns
* Readability and maintainability

---

##  References & Inspiration

* *Head First Design Patterns*
* *Effective Java* — Joshua Bloch
* Interview-driven and real-world backend scenarios
